{"name":"SecureAndroid","tagline":"A small library for encrypting and storing data securely on Android devices.","body":"### Welcome to SecureAndroid\r\nSecureAndroid is a small library that will help you to easily encrypt, decrypt and store data securely on Android devices.\r\nThe library was designed with ease-of-use in mind. You do not have to worry about implementation details of cryptographic algorithms but simply use the provided API. \r\nSecureAndroid uses AES encryption in CBC mode with padding according to PKCS5. For data integrity HMacSHA256 or HMacSHA1 (according to the availability on the device) is used. For key derivation from passwords the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256/1 (according to the availability on the device) is employed. \r\nSecureAndroid abstracts cryptographic implementation details and i/o-operations away so that you can concentrate on your app logic. \r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\nTo use SecureAndroid, simply download the zip or tar.gz file and extract it. In your Android Studio project, \r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
